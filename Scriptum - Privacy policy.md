## Welcome to the Privacy Policy of Scriptum!

#### ⚡ About project ⚡

This project developed by **Alexey Kuznetsov (Serjant Arbuz)** and the main goal is to create an app 
for easy management of notes and planning on Android devices. The app is available for download 
in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sgtmelon.scriptum) store.

#### ⚡ Your information ⚡

In this application, information comes first, and I perfectly understand that your thoughts are the
most secret thing in this world. That's why your trust is very important for me!

All information created by yourself are stored exclusively on your device in the local **database** and
not transmitted to outsiders. This project collect only analytics data about how you interact with interface, 
about corner situations (like bugs and crashes).

#### ⚡ About app permissions ⚡

Here is a list of permissions required by this app and brief explanation of them:

| Permission | Explanation |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Required to track your device restart and needed for update alarms and displaying of notifications in status bar. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user. |
| `android.permission.VIBRATE` | Required to vibrate the device when alarm is ringing. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user. But you can disable this kind of user notification inside app settings. |
| `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK` | Required to show alarm screen when alarm is ringing. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user. |
| `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Enables the app to create foreground services that will ring the alarm, keep it snoozed and keep your status bar notifications up-to-date and always visible (even after application closed). Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user. |
| `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Required to show notifications in status bar. Permission can be granted only by user, and revoked as well. |
| `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | The only sensitive permission that the app requests, and can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. This is required in case if you want to set a custom alarm ring, if you will use backup notes features (to save/load data from your device). Request only for **pre Android-12** devices. |
